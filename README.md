# ecommerce-service

Basic ecommerce service written in Go for educational purposes.

# Prerequisites

You should have at least Go 1.16 installed in your system.

Optionally, if you want to have live reloading code, you must have [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) installed.

# Quickstart

1. This repo is a template. [Use it](https://github.com/cgrs/ecommerce-service-starter/generate) to generate a new repo
in your personal account with the basic folder structure and some boilerplate code (a logging middleware and some tests).

2. After it's created, clone the repository in your machine, navigate to the directory and launch it:

    ```
    cd ecommerce-service/
    go run .
    ```

3. The basic program should greet you with the URL is listening to:
    ```
    2021/08/10 09:22:42 Server is listening on http://localhost:3000
    ```
    Navigate to [that URL](http://localhost:3000) and you'll receive a JSON with the following data:
    
    ```json
    {"status": 200, "message": "OK"}
    ```

    Meanwhile, the terminal should display something like this:

    ```
    2021/08/12 23:48:58 GET / 154.257Âµs
    ```

# Project definition

In order to build a simple ecommerce service, we'll define some entities:

* Customer. In charge of adding items to its basket and making orders.
* Item. Products which are bought by the customers.
* Basket. The temporary storage where a customer decides which products are going to buy.
* Order. After confirming the checkout, the order displays a list of the products bought by a customer in a shopping session.

Given these entities, we can infer these behaviors:

* Customers can make a lot of orders but they have only one basket, corresponding to their current shopping session.
* Customers can modify their baskets as they wish: adding more items, increasing or decreasing some specific item's
  quantity, or even emptying their cart. However, orders are final and they cannot be modified once customers have
  made the checkout.
* Customers are allowed to see how many orders they have made and how much each order was.
* Once a customer decides to checkout, An order is made and their basket is emptied.

To make the development easier, we'll make some assumptions:

* There's an infinite stock of items (that is, we don't need to control how many items are left for customers to buy).
* Customers payment is irrelevant (let's imagine it's managed by other service we cannot configure, but it ensures
  every customer pays their orders).

# Roadmap

Given the previous definition, you'll need to:
- [ ] Develop the customers domain:
    * Basic identity management for customers (Signing up, signing in...). There's no need to get fancy here.
      Just a map of username/passwords in plain text will do. (Needless to say you shouldn't do that in a real
      environment, right? *...* [**_Right?_**](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/081/388/497.jpg)).
    * Get some kind of session management in order to get the customer's basket working. Cookies are more than enough.
- [ ] Develop the items domain:
    * Implement a basic search for customers in order to give them a way to display the items they want to buy.
    * Write some item management endpoints for the owner of the shop to create, update and delete items. (Bonus points
      if you implement a basic role access).
- [ ] Develop the basket domain:
    * Let the customers modify their basket as they want (as said before).
    * Create an order if a customer does checkout and after that, generate a new shopping session for that customer.
- [ ] Develop the orders domain:
    * Write some endpoints to display the orders of a customer.

# Solution

> :warning: If you get stuck, start a discussion in this repo to get hints instead of just copying the solution.

You can find a working solution (not the most optimal though) in the [`solution`](https://github.com/cgrs/ecommerce-service-starter/tree/solution) branch.
